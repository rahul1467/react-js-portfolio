            I am a level and game designer, artist, creative collaborator, writer and storyteller with 6 years experience making games.

            Creating worlds and experiences that impact our culture is my passion.

            I helped bring Rapture to life in the critically acclaimed BioShock series, and made the world dance as design lead on Dance Central. Most recently I sparked the joy of childhood imagination and creativity in Captain Forever Remix as part of a two-person team.
